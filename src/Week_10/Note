Java memory has two main parts, young generation and old memory

Young generation is where new objects created in heap.
It is divided three areas; Eden space and two Survivor space (s0 and s1).
When new objects created, it is allocated in the Eden Space. Most objects are destroyed quickly,
so young generation has short-lived objects.

Old memory has long-lived objects. Old memory larger than younger because
it stores objects with longer lifetimes..
