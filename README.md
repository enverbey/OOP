# OOP Repository for Java Students 📚

This repository has been created to assist individuals taking Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) courses with Java. It aims to provide resources and examples to enhance understanding and practical skills in OOP concepts.

## Java Basics Folder 📁

A `Java-Basics` folder has been established within this repository. This folder serves as a foundational resource, focusing on essential Java skills that are crucial for grasping object-oriented programming. As you embark on learning OOP, it's important to have a solid understanding of basic Java coding principles. This ensures that you can effectively write and comprehend the code necessary for OOP.

## Continuous Updates 📅

In line with the topics covered in school, I plan to regularly add new folders and resources to this repository. This will help keep the materials relevant and up-to-date with the curriculum.

## A Note from the Creator 🙋‍♂️

I am also a student, so there may be errors in my work, and the design might not be perfect! Please feel free to reach out for any additions, edits, suggestions, or requests. Your feedback is valuable, whether it's regarding the code files or the README documentation. If you can improve this repository's content or structure, I would appreciate your insights. 

### Special Thanks ❤

I will create a section to acknowledge the friends who have regularly assisted me in completing this repository. Their contributions have been invaluable, and I will link their GitHub profiles here.

## Upcoming Updates 🚀

Please note that a `tr` folder (for Turkish content) will be added to the `Java-Basics` section soon. Stay tuned!
