# 📚 Variables and Data Types

Welcome to the **Variables and Data Types** section of the Java Basics repository! In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Java.

## 🤔 What are Variables?

Variables are like containers that store data values. In Java, every variable has a specific type, which determines what kind of data it can hold. Understanding variables is essential because they allow you to store, modify, and retrieve data throughout your program.

### 🌟 Key Points:
- A variable must be declared before it can be used.
- Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, characters, and boolean values.

## 📊 What are Data Types?

Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a variable. In Java, there are two main categories of data types:

1. **Primitive Data Types**: These are the most basic data types built into the language. They include:
   - `int`: Represents integer values (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
   - `double`: Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14).
   - `char`: Represents single characters (e.g., 'A').
   - `boolean`: Represents true or false values.

2. **Reference Data Types**: These refer to objects or arrays and are not defined by the primitive types. For example:
   - `String`: Represents a sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello").


### 💡 Importance of Data Types
Choosing the correct data type is crucial as it affects the amount of memory allocated and the operations that can be performed on that data.
